# Induction.
Parneet Singh ( IT department GNDEC Ludhiana
# DAY 1
My day starts with an excitement,energetic feeling and as well as nervous, scared of the unknown but i somehow managed to get my weak emotions in control and said to myself :- "LET IT BE" 
As an Daily bus traveller to arrive to college ( it was also my first time in the bus alone ),the time were vanishing so fast in the bus that i cant describe 
i got into college exact 8:47 
## Gurudwara Sahib Darshan 
Seeing the amount of shoes in that much quantity as well as quality - My fear Grows bigger of the UNKNOWN 
# Revelation 
The soon as i enter it - I felt a Presence of something normal, something similar and something unharmful - As my body sense No Dangers - All Students were also having their first day and all 
i qoute comes to mind:-
## We Suffer More In Reality Than In Imagination - SENECA
