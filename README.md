# DAY 1
My day starts with an excitement,energetic feeling and as well as nervous, scared of the unknown but i somehow managed to get my weak emotions in control and said to myself :- "LET IT BE" 
As an Daily bus traveller to arrive to college ( it was also my first time in the bus alone ),the time were vanishing so fast in the bus that i cant describe 
i got into college exact 8:47
